# TCodeESP32-SR6MB
This is a modified version of the Tempests TCode sketch that includes a menu specifically for SR6MB. The menu can be easily accessed and navigated using just three buttons, so no coding skills are required for the user. The modified sketch also includes additional features such as a sleeve heater, a display, buttons, a menu, four vibration channels, and a squeeze servo channel.
